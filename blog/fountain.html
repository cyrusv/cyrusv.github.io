			<p>I get disappointed when people dismiss very contemporary art. Not disappointed in them, but in all the institutions who try and fail to share art. It's disappointing that educational institutions like schools and museums fail to actually reach people, allowing and sometimes reinforcing the “That's not art: even I could make that” attitude. For me, a single good explanation of a single well-made piece of art is all it took learn how to understand (or at least appreciate) a class of work that was previously conceptually off-limits.
			</p>
			<p>
			Let's look at my favorite piece: <a href="http://greynotgrey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/fountain.jpg">The Fountain,"</a> by Marcel Duchamp. I was hesitant to blog about what I originally thought to be a well-understood interpretation of a fairly famous piece of art. But the first five google hits give terrible, sometimes blatantly wrong interpretations. "Since the photograph taken by Stieglitz is the only image of the original sculpture, there are some interpretations of "Fountain" by looking not only at reproductions but this particular photograph. Tomkins notes that "it does not take much stretching of the imagination to see in the upside-down urinal's gently flowing curves the veiled head of a classic Renaissance madonna or a seated Buddha or, perhaps more to the point, one of Brancusi's polished erotic forms." "It was a prank, meant to taunt his avant-garde peers." A lot of the rhetoric is misleading and underinformed, seeming to just recycle buzz-words ("prank", "readymade", etc.) and one of Duchamp's quotes. Besides under-informed articles, I found heaps of jargon that might have been used to repel non-artists. Other explanations are what many engineers might call "artsy fluff" or “whatever-I-write-is-true” interpretations.
			</p>
			<p>
			Let me give an explanation that can be engaging to a non-artist, while maintaining accuracy.
			</p>
			<p>
			The story of “The Fountain” makes a lot more sense with historical context. Western art was almost completely in a trend of visualizing idealism or realism, from Greek to Renaissance, and into 19th Century Romantic and Neo-Classical art. The ancient Greek statues of muscular men and “Mona Lisa” represent this. The impressionists were the first to aggressively break this tradition, and were promptly rejected. They made their own schools and exhibits. But post-impressionists were too crazy for even the impressionists. So the impressionists rejected post-impressionists' ugly, talentless work (this is what most people consider “modern art”) from their schools and exhibits. The pattern emerged of rejecting the cutting edge, and the cutting edge making new exhibits and schools. These schools were supposed to be completely open to the most progressive and forward-thinking art. Marcel Duchamp chaired a committee of such an exhibit.
			</p>
			<p>
			Duchamp submitted "The Fountain" anonymously to the exhibit, somewhat as a test. When it was rejected from his own committee, he resigned. The committee failed to grasp the creative work that went into this work (obviously, as a readymade, no physical work went into it). Looking at a urinal, turning it sideways, and calling it a fountain demonstrates that anything can be something else if you look at it the right way. It encourages the viewer to regain their lost, child-like imagination and creativity that let you crawl into a cardboard box and call it a space ship. Further, it opens the door to viewers discovering meaning in everything around them. Duchamp was trying to explain to people that creative inspiration, life lessons, new perspectives are all around us. If we take on some responsibility and try to learn from all of our experiences, then the world becomes a much different place. Duchamp's panel was still thinking the old way, that the artist is puts physical labor into a work, lecturing the viewer. In a sense, Duchamp's readymade makes everyone an artist and everything a work of art, eliminating a professional artist as the bottleneck to creativity. "The Fountain," then, opens up that everything, no matter how mundane, can be meaningful if you choose to get something out of it.

			Audio guides in museums should be written by people who aren't professional artist or art curators if they want to engage a more general audience and make art relatable.
