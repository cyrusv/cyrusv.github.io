		Square recently released a new product: Pay with Square. Yesterday, I walked up to my favorite food truck (Momogoose), and told them my order. They asked
		my name, and I told them. I got my food and left, not once touching my wallet or phone. They use geo-location
		to notify the cashier that you are approaching, and shows your profile with a name and picture, charging in the background after your identity is confirmed.
		It blows my colleagues' minds that Google wallet or Paypal doesn't already do this.
		Why can't I just pay with Paypal at a food truck? And why is Google wallet struggling to gain market share?
		</p>
		<p>
		The answer to these questions is probably quite complicated, but we can learn a lot by examining why Square chose not to come out of the blocks
		with Pay with Square. I believe this was a conscious decision by the founder, a decision a lot of engineers would disagree with: to found the company on a phycial
		reader using physical credit cards. Why bother making
		a physical device? Why are people still carrying physical credit cards? A forward-thinking software engineer knows that the way to be ahead of the curve
		would be to go straight software and use some network communication. The reason Square made a card-reader is simple: Everybody already uses cards.
		The card reader is an absurdly well-made stepping stone to their midterm and longterm plan of truly great solutions.
		</p>
		<p>
		An MIT student or recent graduate could never have gotten Pay with Square to a large audience. This is because the ugly, clunky solution had to come first to win
		trust and traction of the general public. Then, they can be eased into a smarter way of doing things.
